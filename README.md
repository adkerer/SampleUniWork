# SampleUniWork
In this repo I showcase some of my sample code I have created in group assignments in my bachelor thesis and master's courses, such as [Statistical Machine Learning](https://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kpid=32691&type=1), [Advanced Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=1RT003&lasar=), [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=1DL340) and [Algorithms and Datastructures II](https://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=1DL231) and courses from my exchange at Tokyo Institute of Technology.

Please see my [Academic Portfolio](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Academic%20Portfolio) as well to get a more comprehensive overview of my M. Sc. in Sociotechnical Systems Engineering work.
